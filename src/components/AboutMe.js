      <p>
        Hey there! I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems
        from Max Stern Yezreel Valley College. I'm super motivated and love
        working with others in fast-paced, ever-changing environments. I'm ready
        to put my skills and passion to work for a company that shares my values
        and mission. I know my way around HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap,
        jQuery, ReactJS, NodeJS, SQL, PHP, and Java. I'm excited to explore
        opportunities where I can apply my skills and passion to drive
        meaningful impact.
      </p>
